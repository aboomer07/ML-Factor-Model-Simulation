# ML-Factor-Model-Simulation
Final Project for Machine Learning Replication of Factor Model Paper

Replication of a paper, "In-sample inference and forecasting in misspecified factor models" by Carrasco and Rossi, focused on in-sample prediction and out-of-sample forecasting in high dimensional models. Four dimension reduction devices are used: Principal Components, Ridge Regression, Landweber Fridman (LF), and Partial Least Squares (PLS).
Generalized Cross Validation (GCV) and Mallows criterions are used to validate model performance on simulated data. Six different data generation processes (DGP's) are introduced for the monte carlo simulation.
